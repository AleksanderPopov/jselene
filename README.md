# JSelene

This project is a completely draft version of [Selene](https://github.com/yashaka/selene) port to Java.

Currently there is unclear whether this project will be evolving or not.

It still may be used
- as a draft for your own selenium based wrapper (the license is MIT, so just do whatever you want with this sources).
- as an example of some framework to learn something new and being inspired, etc...
- or probably to develop more simple, KISS and more OOP-like alternative to [Selenide](http://selenide.org)

Cheers!
